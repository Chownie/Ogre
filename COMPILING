To compile:

Make sure you have the Go toolchain downloaded. You may have it in your repository but it's distro agnostic (and OS agnostic to some extent)
so you can just download the gzipped tarball at http://golang.org if you wish. Follow the instructions! Compiling something with required
external packages means your $GOROOT *must* be set!

External packages:
	`go get github.com/nsf/termbox-go`
	`go get github.com/chownplusx/termbox-additions`

	NOTE: If you have these installed and wish to update, use the -u flag. The go util will not make a check against the online repo unless
	you tell it to. It will needlessly reinstall your local copy.

If you have those 2 packages installed, building is as easy as doing

`go build`

This will result in a binary called Ogre.
