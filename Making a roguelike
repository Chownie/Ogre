o I'm making one of these things. I noticed that [LAMMJ][LAMMJohnson] was making one, it looked fun, and I'd never worked with ncurses before.

``` go
createMenu() {
c1 := m.NewItem("Black & Yellow", "BY")
c2 := m.NewItem("Black & Red", "BR")

// When using NewForm & NewMenu (passing a pointer to array of pointers in C) remember to add a nil entry to the end of your slice.
items := []*m.Item{c1, c2, nil}
menu, _ = m.NewMenu(items)

menu.SetWin(windows[1].w)
// Derwin creates a subwindow with a position that is relative to the parent window.
dw, _ := windows[1].w.Derwin(5, 19, 4, 3)
menu.SetSub(dw)

windows[1].w.Addstr(6, 2, "Border color", 0)

menu.Post()
windows[1].w.Refresh()
}```

The desire to use ncurses died actually very quickly after seeing the usage. It's irritating that you have to read through the documentation
constantly because all of the functions have odd naming. This, on top of the fact that it requires you to manage memory despite Go being a 
garbage collected lang was quite bewildering. So instead I started work on something called [termboxadds][Termbox-Additions]. [termbox][Termbox] is
a lovely simple ncurses-like lib written by [nsf][nsf] the author of other helpful tools like Go-Code. It lacked the extensions like menus and forms
however, so I had to write them in. Thankfully there's really nice documentation for [termbox][Termbox] so it wasn't an issue to write this in.

After having done that, the result is this:
